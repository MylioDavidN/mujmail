<p>Provides classes for transforming pointer events produced by touchscreen to higher level events. There are currently implemented higher level events that emulates keyboard.</p>

<h3>Adding touchscreen support to custom user interface class</h3>
To listen to mujMail high level pointer events define class implementing interface {@link mujmail.pointer.MujMailPointerEventListener} and create object of this class. Than, create object of class {@link mujmail.pointer.MujMailPointerEventProducer}. Pass the instance of {@link mujmail.pointer.MujMailPointerEventListener} created in previous step to the constructor of this object. Than, J2ME low level pointer events must be catched - to do this overload methods {@link javax.microedition.lcdui.Canvas#pointerPressed}, {@link javax.microedition.lcdui.Canvas#pointerDragged} and {@link javax.microedition.lcdui.Canvas#pointerReleased} and call appropriate methods of newly created object. Now, every time when some mujMail event is produced, appropriate method on {@link mujmail.pointer.MujMailPointerEventListener} is called</p>

<p>To implement interface {@link mujmail.pointer.MujMailPointerEventListener}, adapter class {@link mujmail.pointer.MujMailPointerEventListener.MujMailPointerEventListenerAdapter} should be used. This prevents compilations errors when some new method to interface {@link mujmail.pointer.MujMailPointerEventListener} is added. Than, it does not force user to implement all methods of this interface it is not needed.</p>

<h3>Creating new pointer events</h3>
<p>To create new pointer event, subclass class {@link mujmail.pointer.MujMailPointerEvent}. In method {@link mujmail.pointer.MujMailPointerEvent#handleEvent(mujmail.pointer.MujMailPointerEventListener)} the event should call some method on listener passed as the argument of this method. If it should be some new action, new method to interface {@link mujmail.pointer.MujMailPointerEventListener} must be added. </p>

<p>Than, the event must be produced. That is why methods in class {@link mujmail.pointer.MujMailPointerEventProducer} producing events - that means for example method {@link mujmail.pointer.MujMailPointerEventProducer#transformPointerPressed(int, int)} - must be changed in order to produce new event. Another possibility is to create descendant of {@link mujmail.pointer.MujMailPointerEventProducer} that will override such methods and than use object of this new class to produce events instead of object of class {@link mujmail.pointer.MujMailPointerEventProducer}.</p>
