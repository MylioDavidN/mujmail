There are now two implementation of this class. {@link mujmail.RMSStorage} is used to store the content of body part in RMS database. It uses class {@link mujmail.MailDB} for saving and loading fragments of the content from RMS database. {@link mujmail.FSStorage} is used to store the content of body part in file in file system of the phone. It does not support writing new content to the storage yet so it is now used only to represent body parts that user attached to the mail when writing an email.</p>
