<p>
Contains classes which deal with HTML body parts parsing. 
</p>

<p>
{@link mujmail.html.Parser Parser} class is responsible for parsing HTML stream.
There are some requirements for Parser functionality:
<ul>
<li>it should be the as simple as possible in meaning of robustness - we do not
require to handle every error in HTML stream (like missing closing tag,
incorrectly paired tags). Parser is not validating the input just wants to
highlight some subset of HTML tags</li>
<li>parser have to process incomplete HTML source. It's available in mujMail to
limit number of downloaded bytes/lines of e-mail so generally we cannot expect
correctly paired tags not even closed (HTML can ends with "<b" for example and
we do not know if that had to be b or br tag)</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
When stream is parsed, vector of elements is returned.<br>
For drawing of these elements we need just to call draw method as we assume that
vector of elements is vector of instances implementing
{@link mujmail.html.Drawable Drawable} interface.
